			You decide to go home. It is really dark, but you know your trustly flashlight can light the way â€” except you didn't bring it with you. so you head on your journey without a flashlight. you walk in the dark woods, trying to get back home. as you continue, you hear some sounds in the dark, and almost instinctively, yous start to run to escape these menacing growls. You fail to see a tree root on the ground, and accidentally trip. you hear the sound of your camera hitting the ground and know that the camera is done for.

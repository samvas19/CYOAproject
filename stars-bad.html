			You decide to go to sleep under the stars. You wake up drenched in water. you start to panic as it continues to rain thinking about how you left your camera exposed. You try to cover the camera, and run back to your cabin, but it is still really dark. thinking about your warm cabin, you fail to see a tree root on the ground, and accidentally trip. you hear the sound of your camera hitting the ground. if the water hasn't courroupted the data yet, you are sure that hit did.
